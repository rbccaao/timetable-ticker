# Timetable Ticker - What period is it? 今は何時限ですか？

A simple web page to tell the current time and school period at A Certain School. 

Made using HTML, Javascript, and Bootstrap 5. 

## Background

This was created in a response to the ever changing schedule at the school I work at. The school timetable has shifted around a few times since the COVID-19 pandemic. So instead of constantly wondering what period we're in, I'll let the computer do the maths.

To be honest, I'm just really lazy and I don't like doing calculations multiple times a day. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
